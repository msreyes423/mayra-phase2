                    <p class="card-text">Give me mermaids and I'm a happy girl. I love mermaids so I couldn't resist watching this drama. Throw in some romance, a bit of action and suspense and you've got what sounds like a drama tailor-made for me to love.</p>
                    <img class="card-img" src="../images/LoTBS3.png">
                    <p class="card-text">"When a Joseon-era mermaid follows her true love to modern-day Seoul, can she survive the strange new environment and avoid the dangers that await her?" This show has such an interesting storyline. The connection to the past between the characters in present day is slowly unveiled and it makes for much intrigue and mystery. So I won't ruin it by giving anything away. But trust me, you'll love it.</p>
                    <img src="../images/LoTBS4.png">
                    <p class="card-text">What I loved about the show, first and foremost, is the lead actress, Jun Ji Hyun who play Shim Cheong. She doesn't fall into the usual tropes in romances of the weak woman who's always following after the man hanging onto his every word. That annoys me to no end so I love that her character is a strong female lead, literally and figuratively, and that she's freaking hilarious. I don't know if I've ever laughed so loud from a drama before. I can't even give an example of one of the many moments because I don't wanna spoil anything so just take my word for it. She shines in this role and I'll be sure to check out her other dramas.</p>
                    <img class="card-img" src="../images/LoTBS5.png">
                    <p class="card-text">Add to that the handsome male lead, Lee Min Ho, and you've got a dynamic pair. I only previously saw him in <em>Boys Over Flowers</em> and I wasn't a big fan of that show due to the aforementioned tropes so he wasn't on my list of actors to watch. But he definitely is now.</p>
                    <img class="card-img" src="../images/LoTBS7.png">
                    <p class="card-text">While I did really enjoy this drama, it left me wanting a little more in the romance area. I will say I'm a bit of a tough critic when it comes to rating shows. Even my most loved show so far only has a 9/10. I guess a 10/10 show would be one I would actually rewatch. I haven't had the urge yet. With that said, I'd give <em>The Legend of the Blue Sea</em> an 8/10. But that is still a very good rating in my book. Despite my critiques, I'd recommend giving this show a try based on Jun Ji Hyun's performance alone. It may leave you wanting more as well but it's definitely worth a watch and you're sure to have plenty of laughs.</p>
