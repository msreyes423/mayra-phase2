              <div class="card-body">
                <h3>Where Can I Watch?</h3>
                <p>You can watch Korean dramas on <a href="https://www.dramafever.com/" target="_blank">Drama Fever</a> or <a href="https://www.viki.com/?locale=en" target="_blank">Viki</a>. They offer paid subscription services where you can watch Asian dramas ad free. However, both sites offer the option to watch many of their shows for free with advertisements. I use both as some shows may be available on one platform and not the other. Both have mobile apps as well. You can also watch Kdramas on Hulu and Netflix. Of the two, I prefer Netflix. It has a constantly growing selection and even has some shows they are producing on their own. Netflix also has the added bonus of offline viewing. I love to download an episode to watch as I am travelling to and from work.</p>
                
                <h3>Do I need to know Korean?</h3>
                <p>Of course not! There's subtitles. But after watching enough dramas you will start to know quite a few Korean words. Here's some often used words I've picked up:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Gajima = Don't go</li>
                  <li>Joahhae = I like you</li>
                  <li>Saranghae = I love you</li>
                  <li>Keurae = Ok</li>
                  <li>Gwenchana? = Are you ok?</li>
                  <li>Namjachingoo/Yujahchingoo = Boyfriend/Girlfriend</li>
                  <li>Miahnhae = I'm sorry</li>
                  <li>Jinja? = Really?</li>
                  <li>Neo michyeosseo? = Are you crazy?</li>
                  <li>Omo = Oh my gosh</li> 
                  <li>Whe? = Why?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What shows do you recommend?</h3>
                <p>There's a lot of genres like sci-fi, mystery, comedy, melodrama, crime, thriller and of course romance (the most popular genre). I must say, I am a sucker for romance. However, I do prefer a mix of romance, action and comedy. My faves so far have been <em>Strong Woman Do Bong Soon</em>, <em>Descendants of the Sun</em>, <em>Doctors</em>, <em>W</em> and <em>Oh My Ghostess</em>.</p>
                
                <h3>Why do some shows have different titles?</h3>
                <p>The translation can sometimes vary so the title may appear differently. For example, Netflix recently added 
                  <em>Strong Woman Do Bong Soon</em> but it's listed as <em>Strong Girl Bong-soon</em>.</p>
                  
                <h3>I keep hearing some words that aren't translated and I'm not sure what they mean.</h3>
                <p>There are a few unique terms that you won't see translated. They are often titles. You can find some of them here:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Oppa = Older brother (used by females). "Oppa" is also loosely used to flirt and show affection for 
                    an older guy not related to a girl.</li>
                    <li>Hyung = Older brother (used by males).</li>
                    <li>Unnie = Older sister (used by females). Can also be used amongst friends and sometimes is used as a diss 
                    to someone your own age.</li>
                    <li>Noona = Older sister. Used by males (related or not) to an older woman or girl.</li>
                    <li>Sunbae/Hoobae = Refers to someone with more/less experience than you at work, school etc.</li>
                    <li>Ahjussi/Ahjumma = Middle aged married man/woman</li>
                    <li>Fighting! = This word clearly isn't Korean but it's a Korean expression meaning "you can do it!", "let's go" or 
                    "good luck" etc.</li>
                  </ul>
