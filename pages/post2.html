                    <h2>The Show I'm Most Excited For This Season</h2>
                    <img src="../images/WYWS.png">
                    <p>I still consider myself a newbie when it comes to Kdramas since it's been less than 2 years since I first started watching. I have a few shows under my belt but when I meet other Kdrama fans and ask about recommendations they always name so many that I have never seen or even heard of. But with an upcoming show or one that's currently airing we are on the same playing field. It's new to us both so we both can be equally excited about the possibilities.</p>
                    <img src="../images/WYWS2.png">
                    <p>The show I have been highly anticipating for the Fall 2017 season is <em>While You Were Sleeping</em>. My excitement stems from the two main actors. The shows I love are because of the main actors for the most part so if they starred in other shows I made it my business to watch those as well. I was excited when I noticed Suzy from <em>Uncontrollably Fond</em> was starring in it. It was the second drama I ever watched and my first Korean drama. It was a melodrama and super intense at times so that meant the actors had to dig deep and she definitely did. For me, she was one to watch. So when this show popped up on my radar it was added to my watchlist immediately simply because she was in it. Then I watched the trailer and I got really excited. Not only was Suzy starring in it but so was Lee Jong Suk from <em>W</em>, one of my fave dramas! The fact that these two are in it tells me this show has got to be a hit but the storyline has me very intrigued as well.</p>
                    <p><em>While You Were Sleeping</em> is about a woman, Hong-joo (Suzy), who can see unfortunate events of the future in her dreams. She meets prosectuor Jae-chan (Lee Jong Suk) who develops the same premonitions as her and fights to make sure her dreams don't come true. What's their connection? Why does he have these dreams too? So many questions come to mind and I'm excited to see where this show goes. If your interests are piqued, check out the official trailer <a href="https://youtu.be/P5LkC8cgZ0U" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                    <p>I can't wait to start watching!</p>
